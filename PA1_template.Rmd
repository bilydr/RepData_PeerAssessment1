## Loading and preprocessing the data

Read the orignial csv file into a data frame and load dplyr package for further analysis
```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis', message=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
dfOrig <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("integer", "Date", "integer"))
dfOrig <- tbl_df(dfOrig)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculate the total number of steps taken each day into a new data frame
```{r}
dfDay<- dfOrig %>% 
    group_by(date) %>% 
    summarize(totalSteps = sum(steps, na.rm = T))
```

Make a histogram
```{r}
hist(dfDay$totalSteps, 
     main = "Historgram of total number of steps taken each day",
     xlab = "total steps taken per day")
```

Calculate the mean and the median
```{r}
mean(dfDay$totalSteps)
median(dfDay$totalSteps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Calculate the average number of steps taken by 5-min interval into a new data frame
```{r}
dfInterval <- dfOrig %>% 
    group_by(interval) %>% 
    summarize(avgSteps = mean(steps, na.rm =T))                      
```

Make a time series plot
```{r}
with(dfInterval, plot(interval, avgSteps, 
                      type = "l",
                      main = "Average Number of Steps by 5-min Interval",
                      xlab = "5-min interval",
                      ylab = "avg. number of steps each day"))
```

Identify the top interval with highest average steps
```{r}
arrange(dfInterval, desc(avgSteps)) [1,]
```
It turns out to be the interval from 8h35 to 8h40.

## Imputing missing values

Find how many NA values that the dataset contains with summary function.
```{r}
summary(dfOrig)
```
2304 rows contain missing values.

As one strategy for filling missing values, I plug in average steps for the 5-min interval as calculated above.  


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
